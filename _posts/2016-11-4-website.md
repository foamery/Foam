So you want to build a website
==============================


Well I'm pretty sure you can do one better then me 
So I'm going to show you how to build one with no hassle

First off you will need

+ github account 

+ cloud flare accountant

+ freenom account 

Those accounts will be what you need to start off with.

Github
===========

1. go onto github and make a respretory called  username.github.io with username being your username

2. make a index.html file at the home page You can find that on internet 

That was pretty much what my first index was but of course you can modified.
You can visit your website by going to username.github.io where again the username is your user name
That is the github side mostly done now it's time to get a domain name and set it up.

3. head over to [dot.tk](http://www.dot.tk/) and register your chosen domain name 

That's pretty much it since the DNS records are done on cloud flare

4. Head over to [cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com)

5. Log in and add a website use your domain the .tk one

6. You will get name servers which you add on .tk

7. Go back to [dot.tk](http://www.dot.tk/) and go to your website

8. There select magement tools then name servers and replace theres with yours

And your done no you can show the world your skills
